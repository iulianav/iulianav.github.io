                        Given the nature of our data set, we encountered several limitations:<br><br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The <b>risk values</b> are categorical, hence we had to map them to numerical values. For this reason, the values we worked with during analysis might not be as accurate as we would wish them to be.</li>
                            <li>Due to the <b>change in violations</b> that occured in July 2018, we had to split the dataset into 2 unbalanced ones (the one following the change is much smaller) to perform certain analysis on the violations, as well as to train some of our models. Hence, the results might yet again not be as accurate as we would wish them to be.</li>

                    <div class="text-corpus" align="justify">Food is essential to human beings, in that it not only provides nutrients for survival, but also satisfies the need for social bonding: people like to gather around meals and beverages, be it going out to eat and drink, or over a home-cooked meal. Either way, food facilities such as restaurants, pubs, coffee shops, and grocery stores are a major part of people's daily lives. However, according to the <a href="https://www.who.int">WHO</a>, 1 in 10 people fall ill every year from eating contaminated food, and 420.000 people die each year as a result. This risk is especially high when eating out at restaurants rather than cooking your own meals. Therefore, monitoring and maintaining food safety in food facilities is crucial for the health and general well-being of the population.<br><br> Chicago is the third largest city in the United States and is home to more than 16.000 food establishments. The Chicago Department of Public Healthâ€™s Food Protection Program aims to ensure that all food preparation in every food establishment across the city is done in compliance with city ordinances and regulations by conducting recurring science-based inspections.<br><br> The <b>Chicago Food Inspection dataset</b> will allow us to determine food safety levels in Chicago and what affects them, predict if a food facility will pass the inspections, and maybe even make some generalizations that apply beyond the city of Chicago. In other words, we want to obtain more insights into food-related risks in Chicago and the attention food establishments pay to the health of their customers, as well as use these to help inspectors quickly detect establishments which are a threat to the Public Health. The chosen dataset gives us information from which we wish to extract interesting patterns for our study.
